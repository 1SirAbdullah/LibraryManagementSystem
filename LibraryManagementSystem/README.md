```java
// Script to bulk add books
public class BulkAddBooks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LibraryManagementSystem system = new LibraryManagementSystem();
        
        // Add multiple books in a batch
        system.addBook("Clean Code", "Robert C. Martin", 10);
        system.addBook("Effective Java", "Joshua Bloch", 5);
        system.addBook("The Pragmatic Programmer", "Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas", 7);
        
        System.out.println("Books added successfully!");
    }
}
```
